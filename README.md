# Quick-draw-classification
Real time classification on the quick draw dataset

# Made a CNN to classify modes of transport from the quick-draw dataset
-->(16-classes)
-->(10000 images each)
-->["aircraft carrier","airplane","ambulance","bulldozer","bus","canoe","car","cruise ship","firetruck","flying saucer","helicopter","hot air balloon","pickup truck","sailboat","speedboat","train"]
-->Achieved an 80-percent classification accuracy

# Facilitates a web-app for real-time classification 
-->Converted the keras model to tensorflow.js model for browser usage
--> Used canvas elements so that user can draw an image
--> Prediction visualization with bar-chart

# Technologies used
--> Python(keras,scikit-learn,openCV,numpy)
--> Javascript(tensorflow.js,tfvis,google bar chart)
-->HTML,CSS
